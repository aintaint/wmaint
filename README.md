This is kind of a repo for what I'm trying to figure out as a WinUI 3 best practices shell application, and let's try to keep the distributable size down to an absolute minimum, I understand that Windows is turning into cross platform runtime library now that's kernel-agnostic, but 135Mb binaries is not very reasonable. The .NET runtime is already there and the binary package format should allow, like Java, these 5k redistributable binaries. That's the point.
